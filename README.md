This application runs a benchmark to compare:
- Computations ran and returned by an edge network
- Computations ran and returned by a typical cloud network

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

**Do not push sensitive keys to GitHub**. You should follow [Next.js' Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for environment variables.

This includes:

- **.env.local**: Use a `.env.local` file for any sensitive keys. These should not be pushed to GitHub.
- **.env**: Use a `.env` file for any application configuration that can be safely committed to GitHub, such as a `PORT` value.

### üåê Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser

By default, Next.js will only load environment variables in the Node.js environment and not load them in the browser.

It may be the case that, in some circumstances, it is necessary to load these values in the browser. To do this, prefix the environment variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=foo
```
