## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

**Do not push sensitive keys to GitHub**. You should follow [Next.js' Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for environment variables.

This includes:

- **.env.local**: Use a `.env.local` file for any sensitive keys. These should not be pushed to GitHub.
- **.env**: Use a `.env` file for any application configuration that can be safely committed to GitHub, such as a `PORT` value.

### üåê Exposing Environment Variables to the Browser

By default, Next.js will only load environment variables in the Node.js environment and not load them in the browser.

It may be the case that, in some circumstances, it is necessary to load these values in the browser. To do this, prefix the environment variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=foo
```

### üî® Environment variables used in this application

Use this table to store and describe the environment variables used in your application so that others can maintain your application.

| Key             | Description                                    | Required |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| PORT            | The port that the application runs on.         | No       |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO | An example value.                              | No       |


## ‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting

This project comes with support for Firebase Hosting out of the box. This consists of:

* A root `firebase.json` file that holds the configuration for Firebase Hosting
* A `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml` file, the GitHub Action that deploys your application to the Web

To use the application, provide your secret keys in the format specified on your repository's secrets.

You can find these by going to `Settings -> Secrets -> New Repository Secret`.

| Key                          | Required |
|------------------------------|----------|
| FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT     | Yes      |
| FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID          | Yes      |
| FIREBASE_API_KEY             | No       |
| FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN         | No       |
| FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET      | No       |
| FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID | No       |
| FIREBASE_APP_ID              | No       |
